    <p>One of the "Four Murderers" in ancient Chinese myths and legends [6], he is a descendant of the Western Emperor Shaohao, who was exiled by Shun and moved to the Four Descendants for destroying faith and loyalty, and worshipping evil words. Together with Chaos, Hanji, and Gluttony, they are known as the "Four Great Beasts" in ancient times [7]. The Classic of Mountains and Seas Â· the Northern Classic of the Sea records that Qiqi looks like a tiger, the size of a cow, and has a pair of wings [3]. Legend has it that Qiqi has a fierce temperament and likes to eat people. Disloyalty, not listening to good people, listening to bad words [10].</p>
