    <h1>The Kunpeng</h1>

    <p>Zhuangzi gave "Kunpeng" a profound metaphor. In the metaphor of "Kunpeng", Zhuangzi refers to desire, will, and motivation with the northern underworld, and the spiritual wisdom and natural heavenly way with the southern underworld. The process of Kunpeng flying from the North to the South is the process of controlling the will of desire with the wisdom of the soul and returning the human heart to the heart of the Dao, which is the process of people pursuing the Great Dao. The three leaps of Kunpeng from a fish to a bird, flying in anger and swaying upwards are the process of people getting rid of the shackles of desire and moving closer to the realm of forgetting things and self, and they are also the real beginning of marching towards the realm of non-waiting that is one with the Tao.</p>
