    <p>The nine-tailed sky fox usually refers to the nine-tailed fox. The nine-tailed fox, the Xuan fox, the white fox, etc., first appeared in the totemic beliefs of primitive religions. "The Classic of Mountains and Seas" records the nine-tailed fox of Qingqiu. Interpreting these ancient records, the nine-tailed fox is actually a totem of the primitive tribe of Qingqiu, located in the east or south, and the "Classic of Mountains and Seas" says that it "can eat people", indicating that it has divinity in threatening the enemy and protecting the safety of its own tribe. It is also said that "the eater does not Gu" - eating its meat can not be harmed by evil spirits, which is obviously the primitive witchcraft related to the belief in the totem of the nine-tailed fox, believing that the nine-tailed fox has the magic power to ward off evil spirits.</p>
